            <p class="lead">A versioning control system is a system that is responsible for keeping up with and tracking the changes to one specific file or a set of files. These files are kept track of over a long period of time so that it is possible to recall specific versions in the future. This VCS automatically notes important pieces of file information such as who changed the file and at what time, what was changed about the file specifically, and if anything new was added to that file. There are numerous different types of versioning control systems such as local data model, client-server model, and distributed model. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> A local repository is a concept that has to do with file storage. It refers to a copy of the users personal installation which is a chase of the remote downloads. This local repository often also contains temporary build artifacts that may have not yet been released. Local repositories are considered to be “local” because they are repositories that reside on the local machine of the individual user and not the remote server. There are two different ways that a user is able to create a local repository. It is possible to start from scratch and create a brand new repository. You can also clone an existing repository onto a local machine.

            </h2>
              <p class="lead"> A remote repository is very similar to a local repository, except for some minor changes. With a remote repository, the location is slightly different. This type of repository resides on a remote server, which means a server that is not in your immediate area (aka “local”). This type of remote is commonly shared among multiple team members instead of one individual user. It is possible to clone a repository from a remote server using Git. Git will instantly store this information in regards to this connection for the user and save it as a remote that is called “origin.” That way it is possible to utilize a repository from a remote server using this.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is very popular among computer users. This source is designed to handle many different types of tasks, from very small to very large projects for school, work, and pleasure. Git is able to handle all of these tasks with great speed and efficiency. Most people gravitate towards the use of git because everything on it is local and each user is able to have a complete copy of the repository data that can be stored locally into your own personal machine. Git is also a great source because it has the capability to prevent unintentional overwrite of any file that resides on the shared repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many different commands that can be used through git to help create an easier and more efficient work process. Some basic commands include git init, git add —all, git commit —am ‘initial commit’, git log, and git status. Aside from basic commands, there are also remote commands which can include, git remote, git pull, and git push. The most well known and often utilized of the commands is “git config.” This sets configuration values for the users username, email, gpg key, preferred diff algorithm, file formats, and more. This is how users identify that it is theirs. All of the git commands are extremely helpful when using this application. </p>
